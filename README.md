# SleepPortalViewerPublic

Sleep Portal Viewer was developed by a collaboration between Case Western Reserve University and Brigham and Women's Hospital to extend the original Physio-MIMI viewer as an open source MATLAB EDF viewer. The viewer enables the user to open an EDF file and a corresponding sleep annotation file, which contains sleep scoring information. The user can select the signals to view and a myriad of ways are provided to scroll through the signals including: scrolling, clicking on the Hypnogram, and clicking on a specific annotation.

The portal is currently configured to read an EDF and an XML file stored in a Compumedics format.
